# Regional formats

CV conventions are not universal. The default workflow assumes an Anglo (US/UK)
résumé; applying its rules to a German Lebenslauf actively harms the candidate —
it strips the photo, date of birth, nationality, and signature a German recruiter
expects. **Auto-detect the format from the document; do not ask.** Once detected,
the regional rules here override the Anglo defaults in the parseability checklist
for the affected fields.

## Auto-detection (run during Step 2, on the CV itself)

### German / DACH Lebenslauf
**Language is the gate.** Trigger the German layer only if the CV body is actually
German **or** the document is explicitly titled "Lebenslauf". A photo, a German
address, or a DE/AT/CH employer are *not* enough on their own — plenty of
English-language "international" CVs are written by people based in Germany, often
with a photo. If the body, headings, and dates are English, treat it as the Anglo/
international format even with a photo and a Berlin address (this is the common case
for tech and international roles).

Once the language gate is met, these confirm it and tell you which conventions to
apply: German section headings (*Berufserfahrung, Ausbildung, Kenntnisse, Sprachen,
Persönliche Daten*); a personal-data block (*Geburtsdatum/Geburtsort,
Nationalität/Staatsangehörigkeit, Familienstand*); a top-right photo and/or a
signature line (*Ort, Datum*); MM.YYYY dates; a dates-left/details-right tabular
rhythm; a DE/AT/CH employer.

If the gate is **not** met but a photo is present (an English CV with a photo, as is
common in Germany), keep the photo question as a candidate decision (see overrides)
but otherwise apply the Anglo rules — do not import the German personal-data
conventions.

If detected, you already know you're inside the German regional layer — apply the
overrides below and do **not** Anglicise it. The same conventions broadly cover
Austria and German-speaking Switzerland (DACH). For a concrete before/after that
shows these overrides in action, see the German Lebenslauf variant in
`references/worked-example.md`.

## German / DACH overrides

**Keep the personal data the Anglo rules would strip.** Photo, date/place of birth,
nationality, and (optionally, fading) marital status are normal and **not** treated
as discriminatory in Germany. A signature with place and date at the bottom is
expected in traditional sectors. Keep them.

**The two-layer rule (why the photo is safe).** An ATS ignores images entirely —
the photo neither helps nor breaks parsing. The human reviewer who sees the ranked
application *expects* it in traditional sectors. So a photo is parser-neutral and
human-positive: keep it as an inline image top-right, ensure it contains no
essential text, and keep name and contact details as live text near the top.

**Sector nuance for the photo/signature:**
- *Traditional* (Mittelstand, finance, law, public sector, manufacturing): include
  photo, signature, and fuller personal data.
- *Tech, startups, international, English-language roles*: photo is increasingly
  dropped under EU anti-discrimination norms and some ATS strip it; signature
  optional. When in doubt for these, omit the photo.

**Layout — same parser-safety as everywhere.** The classic *tabellarisch* dates-left
/ details-right look is fine **only when built with tab stops**, because it then
extracts as a single stream. Real two-column tables, sidebars, text boxes, skill
bars, and icons still break parsing — do not use them.

**Watch the popular free templates.** Many widely-circulated `.docx` Lebenslauf
templates — especially "modern" designs — build the whole layout from **text boxes
and floating frames**, which a text extractor drops **silently**: you get an *empty*
or scrambled extraction, not an obvious error, so the break is easy to miss.
(Verified against two common free templates: a text-box-based "modern" one extracted
to nothing.) So don't assume a clean-looking Lebenslauf parses — **run an extraction
and confirm it yields ordered, selectable text** before trusting it. If a candidate
hands you one of these, the content is fine; the container isn't — rebuild it as a
single-stream, tab-stop layout (and export to PDF with a real text layer).

**File & dates.** PDF is the German standard (selectable text, not a flattened
image); name it `Lebenslauf_Vorname_Nachname.pdf`. Use one date format (MM.YYYY)
throughout. Account for **every** timeline gap — German recruiters expect no
unexplained gaps; label them (*Elternzeit, Weiterbildung, Sabbatical*).

**Language & keywords.** Write in the posting's language — German CV for a German
posting, English for an English one — and do not blend; keep separate DE and EN
versions. For German postings, mirror the posting's *Aufgaben* (tasks) and
*Anforderungen* (requirements) terms; the parser must handle German compound words
and umlauts, so use the exact posting spellings.

**Section order.** Persönliche Daten → Berufserfahrung → Ausbildung →
Kenntnisse/Skills → Sprachen (with CEFR levels) → Weiterbildung/Zertifikate →
Interessen → *Ort, Datum, Unterschrift*. Length 1–2 pages (3 for senior).

**It's a set, not a CV alone.** A German *Bewerbung* is Anschreiben (cover letter)
+ Lebenslauf + Anlagen (Arbeitszeugnisse / certificates). Flag to the candidate that
the Lebenslauf is one part; the Anschreiben and Arbeitszeugnisse carry real weight.

**De-slop in German.** The de-slop principles in `deslop-cv.md` are
language-agnostic (cut empty boosters, keep referential keywords, drop `-ing`/
participle inflation), but its word list is English. Apply the principles, with the
German starter list below. Treat it as **hints, not a blocklist** — there is no
canonical open-source German AI-slop list, and research on the English equivalents
shows single words are weak signals (many are ordinary writing). Flag a term only
when it's an *empty* booster, never when it's doing real work; the keyword guard
applies in German exactly as in English.

German CV slop to watch for:
- *Boosters:* ergebnisorientiert, leidenschaftlich, nachweisliche Erfolgsbilanz,
  ganzheitlich, dynamisch, innovativ, zukunftsweisend, hochmotiviert, Synergien,
  präzise, sauber, umfassend — replace with the concrete fact.
- *Stock openers/closers:* "In der heutigen Zeit/Welt…", "Lassen Sie uns…",
  "Tauchen Sie ein in…", "Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen…", "Es ist jedoch wichtig
  zu beachten, dass…", "Insgesamt…" — cut and start with the substance.
- *The "nicht nur…, sondern auch…" construction* used as filler parallelism.
- *Filler auxiliaries* (werden/können/haben) padding bullets — prefer a direct verb.
- *Overused connectors* "zudem"/"ferner" stacked as transitions.
- *Mechanics:* unnecessary hyphens in compound adjectives, and uniform sentence/
  paragraph length — same tells as in English.

## Maintaining ONE document in two languages

Everything above is about producing a CV for a market. This is a different and later failure:
keeping an English and a German edition of the *same* document correct as it changes. All three
below have been observed live on a published CV before anyone caught them.

**A shared field leaks the wrong language, and it leaks where a recruiter looks first.** In a
data-driven CV the prose gets translated because it is obviously prose; the metadata does not,
because it does not look like language. A single `dates` field renders the English month
abbreviation and the English word for "present" inside the German edition. Certification
metadata does the same with its issue label. A German recruiter meets both before reading a
sentence.

The fix is per-language fields — `dates_de`, `meta_de` — rendered through the same language spans
the translated prose already uses. **Audit every field that renders without passing through a
translation step**, not just the ones that read like sentences: dates, durations, "Present",
issue and expiry labels, employment type, location qualifiers, and any unit or currency.

**Typography is per-language, and mixing it is a tell.** German uses a spaced en dash as the
*Gedankenstrich*; English uses the em dash. A document can use em dashes throughout while
*already* using en dashes correctly for numeric ranges — internally inconsistent as well as
wrong, and it took two dozen line changes on the German side while the English needed none.
This is not the em-dash-as-AI-tell question; it is orthography, and it differs by language.

**Second-language text needs an independent native review, and the reason is specific: the
errors are fluent.** The failure to look for is a **meaning inversion** — a sentence that is
grammatical, idiomatic, and says the opposite of the source. Constructed example of the shape:

> EN: *the commercial tools were evaluated and rejected on licence cost*
> DE: *die kommerziellen Werkzeuge wurden geprüft und wegen günstiger Lizenzkosten gewählt*

Every word is correct German. It says they were **chosen for their favourable licence cost**.
Nothing is wrong with the sentence except that it is false.

**No spell-checker, grammar linter or style tool catches that**, because there is no error to
find — only a mismatch with a source it never sees. The method that works is two independent
native-level reviews with **no shared context**: two reviewers who have not seen each other's
notes and are not told what the English said. Run that way on a single CV they returned dozens
of items and agreed on the substance, and the agreement is what makes it worth something.

**This belongs here rather than in a readability or register skill.** A CV is a summary paragraph
plus fragments: it has no paragraph junctions to measure, and a cohesion tool correctly reports
nothing to check on one. The transferable part is only the second reader.

## Other regions (brief)

- **Europass** (EU standard template): structured and widely parseable, but its
  default two-column variants can scramble — prefer the single-column export and the
  same parser-safety rules.
- **General principle for any region:** detect the local format, keep the
  human-expected conventions of that market, and keep them out of the parser's way
  (live text near the top, images carrying no essential text, single-stream layout).
  When the local convention and parser-safety genuinely conflict, satisfy the parser
  for machine-read fields and the human for presentation fields — that's the
  two-layer rule generalised.
