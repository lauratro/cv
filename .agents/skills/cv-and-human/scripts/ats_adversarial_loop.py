"""
Measured ATS-lens harness for cv-and-human's red-team pass.

This drives the *measuring* half of the red team's ATS lens: it scores a CV through
a real ATS critic N times and reports the distribution (median / min / range), so
push-back targets the typical outcome rather than a single lucky run. The red team
*finds* weaknesses; the tailor *fixes* the truthful ones — this script only measures.

Design notes:
- The critic is non-deterministic, so a single score is meaningless. We always
  sample N>=5 and compare distributions.
- The scorer is pluggable. Provide a shell command that takes a CV path and prints
  the critic's JSON to stdout (e.g. a local `hiring-agent` invocation), or use the
  built-in stub for testing the harness logic without a model backend.

Usage:
  # Real critic. Point --scorer-cmd at a small adapter that prints {"total": N} to
  # stdout (interviewstreet/hiring-agent's own score.py prints a human report, not
  # JSON). PREFERRED adapter converts the PDF to markdown UPSTREAM (deterministic,
  # via markitdown) and feeds the text straight to the scorer — 1 LLM call, not ~7;
  # see references/red-team.md, "Wiring a real hiring-agent scorer":
  python ats_adversarial_loop.py score --cv cv.pdf \\
      --scorer-cmd "python /path/hiring-agent/score_md.py {cv}" --runs 10

  # Harness self-test with the deterministic-ish stub:
  python ats_adversarial_loop.py selftest

The scorer is non-deterministic: an occasional run yields malformed output and is
skipped (reported as "N failed/skipped"), not fatal. Raise --runs if many fail.
Below --min-successful (default 5) valid runs it refuses to report a median — a
distribution over a handful of survivors is noise, not signal.
